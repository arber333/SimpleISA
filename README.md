# SimpleISA
Simple library for IVT shunts. 
Based on the EVTV library of 2016, revised for use with CHAdeMO.
Compatible with Arduino Due

I managed to program ISA code to see +/- keys for innitializing different direction for current reporting.
Replace your code with files inside SimpleISA.zip
Replace your ino file with LeafVCUChademo.zip if you use it with that VCU otherwise see details within and adjust your code.

When in serial monitor inside settings menu you can select +/- keys to innitialize positive or negative current orientation
I am pretty sure i could make the same interface for voltage too.
