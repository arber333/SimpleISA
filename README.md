# SimpleISA
Simple library for IVT shunts. 
Based on the EVTV library of 2016, revised for use with CHAdeMO.

I managed to program ISA code to see +/- keys for innitializing different direction for current reporting.

When in serial monitor inside settings menu you can select +/- keys to innitialize positive or negative current orientation
I am pretty sure i could make the same interface for voltage too.

*Update Feb 05,2025 by @outlandnish*: Adapted to work with any CAN_COMMON provider (e.g. MCP2515, ESP32, etc.).
